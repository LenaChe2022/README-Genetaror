# README-GENERATOR     

## Description

My motivation was to practice the knowlege I've got on NodeJS Module, and applying Node Package Manager.
My aim was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from user's input using the Inquirer package.
This application allows to quickly create a professional README for a new project.
During this project I learned how to work with npm and NodeJS.
